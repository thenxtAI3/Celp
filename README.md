# Celp!: The college Yelp!

If you're like any other college student, you remember making one of the hardest decisions in your life, the college you were going to attend. The long hours researching the school you want to go to with the goal of trying to find out if the school is really right for you. Well, now there's a solution!

Celp! is an app that aims to deliver the genuine consumer review to colleges and universities.

Universities do their best to make their school sound like it was meant for you. They do so by either stretching the truths, or leaving the bad stats out of the picture. Now, you can learn directly from the students how they see your "dream school" from the inside. This is how college decision making should be, transparent and real. Don't let surprises get the best of you.
Go into college knowing that you made the right decision!

*This app was developed by 5 freshmen during OtterHacks 2017 in CSU Monterey Bay.
